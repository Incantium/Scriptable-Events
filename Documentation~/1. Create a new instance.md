# [Scriptable Events](../README.md)

## 1. Create a new instance

Before writing any code, it is important to first create the event channel you desire as a
[ScriptableObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html). For the pre-build event channel
implementations, go to "Create ⇾ Events" in the Create window. Here, you can choose between a Send
([event bus](../API~/EventBus.md)), or a Request ([event truck](../API~/EventTruck.md)) channel. Give the newly
created event channel a fitting name; that is the only way to specify its purpose for the game you are making.

Within this tutorial, we will create a new float event bus under "Create ⇾ Events ⇾ Send ⇾ Float".
