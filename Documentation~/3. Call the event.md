## 3. Call the event

```csharp
using Incantium.Events.Send;
using UnityEngine;

/// <summary>
/// Class representing the player's health.
/// </summary>
public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField]
    [Tooltip("The health of the player.")]
    [Min(0f)]
    private float health;
    
    [SerializeField]
    [Tooltip("Event channel to be called when the health updates. Will send over the current health of the player.")]
    private FloatEventBus eventBus;

    /// <summary>
    /// Method called when the player has been hit. This method will decrease the player's health and call the event
    /// channel to update the other systems.
    /// </summary>
    private void OnCollisionEnter(Collision _)
    {
        health--;
        eventBus.Send(health);
    }
}
```

To call an event channel, a simple script is required like shown above. The following notes are important:

- Just like in [step 2](2.%20Listen%20to%20the%20event.md), the script requires to have a serialized field for the event
  channel. The serialized event channel within this script should match the event channel that listens, so that they
  both use the same event channel to send messages to each other.
- Calling the event channel is done by calling either `Send` or `Request`/`RequestAll`. This requires the correct
  parameters, determined by the event channel, that are send to the method that listens.
