# [Scriptable Events](../README.md)

## 4. Custom events

This package includes pre-build implementations for boolean, integer, float, double,
[Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html),
[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html), and
[GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html). However, this may not be
enough. It could be that you have other classes, interfaces, structs, or enums you want to pass over. It could also be
that your event channel should send over multiple values instead of one. 

This package makes it possible to also create your own event channel implementations in an easy way. In short, you only
need to override the [`EventBus`](../API~/EventBus.md) or [`EventTruck`](../API~/EventTruck.md) you want. Each type
of event channel has the option for one, two, or three parameters.

Here below is a selection of custom event channels as an example:

```csharp
using Incantium.Events.Request;
using Incantium.Events.Send;

[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Events/Send/Custom event")]
public class CustomEventChannel : EventBus<MyClass> {}

[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Events/Send/Two values")]
public class TwoValuesChannel : EventBus<string, float> {}

[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Events/Request/Request with params")]
public class RequestWithParams : EventTruck<float, float> {}
```

> **Note**: Don't forget the 
> [CreateAssetMenu](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CreateAssetMenuAttribute.html) 
> attribute. Without it, you cannot create a serialized instance of the event channel. All event channels are still
> [ScriptableObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html).
